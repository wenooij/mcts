// SearchInterface is the minimal interface to MCTS tree state.
//
// SearchInterface provides a simple flat interface:
//
//   - Select moves the state of the game forward one Step.
//   - Expand reveals available Steps at the current state.
//   - Root reset the game tree to the state at the beginning of search.
//
// The game tree is managed by this package, so it is not required to implement
// one yourself, so long as Select and Root are relatively inexpensive.
// Expand will not be called again for nodes in the game tree.
//
// MCTS proceeds from the root, down the game tree, selecting the best Step
// at each level, until it reaches a frontier leaf node where a random rollout
// is started. The implementor has two choices for the rollout:
//
//  1. Implement ScoreInterface and rely on the defeault rollout strategy.
//  2. Implement RolloutInterface and use a custom strategy.
//
// Which one to use will depend on one's needs:
//
// RolloutInterface allows for a custom implementation of rollouts.
// This may be useful for those who wish to apply custom heuristics for sampling steps.
// Additionally, this may be a good choice when Expand is expensive.
// Lastly, RolloutInterface supports multiple simulations per epoch
// which may provide further flexibility. For instance, running extra
// simulations for promising positions.
//
// Otherwise, the default rollout strategy can be used. This uses the base methods from
// SearchInterface, calling Select and Expand repeatedly until a terminal state has been
// reached (Expand returns an empty slice of steps).
// The resulting score from ScoreInterface.Score is returned and the rollout completes.
// If the implementation does not satisfy ScoreInterface, a random normally distributed
// dummy score is returned.
// The default rollout strategy may be good enough for one's needs and one done not have
// to bother implementing a custom strategy.
// Alternative implementations of Expand which apply heuristics or generates only a single
// steps must be carefully coded. For instance, failure to return available steps randomly
// will introduce biases to search. It has also been reported that optimal play in simulation
// may actually hinder the explorative performance of MCTS.
// Note that Expand can be made less expensive by reusing the same slice.
// The slice will not be retained by the implementation in this package.
