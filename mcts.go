// Priority is used to seed the initial ordering of steps in the MAB min-priority-queue.
// Ideally, the priority value for X should be set to -E[Score(X)], but in practice
// a heuristic is used. Like ExploreFactor, it is critical that the priority be roughly
// proportional to the values returned from Log.Score, otherwise a small value such as -âˆž
// can be used to guarantee that expanded nodes are explored at least once.
// In larger state spaces this may be counterproductive.
// Priority only affects the initial value. The next priority is recomputed in backprop.
//
// ExploreFactor defines the exploration weighting for the node and its subtree.
// If this is 0, the parent's ExploreFactor is copied. By default, a ExploreFactor is
// applied uniformly to all nodes. It is critical that ExploreFactor be roughly
// proportional to the values returned from Log.Score
